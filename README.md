## Overview

**EdgeTAM** is an on-device executable variant of the SAM 2 for promptable segmentation and tracking in videos.
It runs **22× faster** than SAM 2 and achieves **16 FPS** on iPhone 15 Pro Max without quantization.

*In this figure, we show the speed-performance trade-offs of EdgeTAM and other models on iPhone 15 Pro Max (red) and NVIDIA A100 (blue). We report the J&F on the SA-V val dataset as the evaluation metric.*

## Installation

EdgeTAM needs to be installed first before use. The code requires `python>=3.10`, as well as `torch>=2.3.1` and `torchvision>=0.18.1`. Please follow the instructions [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) to install both PyTorch and TorchVision dependencies. You can install EdgeTAM on a GPU machine using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/EdgeTAM.git && cd EdgeTAM

pip install -e .
```

To use the EdgeTAM predictor and run the example notebooks, `jupyter` and `matplotlib` are required and can be installed by:

```bash
pip install -e ".[notebooks]"
```

Note:
1. It's recommended to create a new Python environment via [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) for this installation and install PyTorch 2.3.1 (or higher) via `pip` following https://pytorch.org/. If you have a PyTorch version lower than 2.3.1 in your current environment, the installation command above will try to upgrade it to the latest PyTorch version using `pip`.
2. The step above requires compiling a custom CUDA kernel with the `nvcc` compiler. If it isn't already available on your machine, please install the [CUDA toolkits](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-archive) with a version that matches your PyTorch CUDA version.
3. If you see a message like `Failed to build the SAM 2 CUDA extension` during installation, you can ignore it and still use EdgeTAM (some post-processing functionality may be limited, but it doesn't affect the results in most cases).


## Getting Started

### Downloading the model

Model is available [here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/EdgeTAM/tree/main/checkpoints/edgetam.pt).

### On-device Gradio demo for EdgeTAM
Follow the instructions below to run the on-device demo for EdgeTAM. If you want to quickly try out the demo, you can also go to [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces/chongzhou/EdgeTAM).

Install the dependencies for the Gradio demo:

```bash
pip install -e ".[gradio]"
```

Run the demo:

```bash
python gradio_app.py
```

The demo will be available at http://127.0.0.1:7860/ by default. You can change the port by setting the `--port` argument.

### Image prediction

EdgeTAM has all the capabilities of [SAM](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything) on static images, and we provide image prediction APIs that closely resemble SAM for image use cases. The `SAM2ImagePredictor` class has an easy interface for image prompting.

```python
import torch
from sam2.build_sam import build_sam2
from sam2.sam2_image_predictor import SAM2ImagePredictor

checkpoint = "./checkpoints/edgetam.pt"
model_cfg = "configs/edgetam.yaml"
predictor = SAM2ImagePredictor(build_sam2(model_cfg, checkpoint))

with torch.inference_mode(), torch.autocast("cuda", dtype=torch.bfloat16):
    predictor.set_image(<your_image>)
    masks, _, _ = predictor.predict(<input_prompts>)
```

Please refer to the examples in [image_predictor_example.ipynb](./notebooks/image_predictor_example.ipynb) for static image use cases.

EdgeTAM also supports automatic mask generation on images just like SAM. Please see [automatic_mask_generator_example.ipynb](./notebooks/automatic_mask_generator_example.ipynb) for automatic mask generation in images.

### Video prediction

For promptable segmentation and tracking in videos, we provide a video predictor with APIs for example to add prompts and propagate masklets throughout a video. EdgeTAM supports video inference on multiple objects and uses an inference state to keep track of the interactions in each video.

```python
import torch
from sam2.build_sam import build_sam2_video_predictor

checkpoint = "./checkpoints/edgetam.pt"
model_cfg = "configs/edgetam.yaml"
predictor = build_sam2_video_predictor(model_cfg, checkpoint)

with torch.inference_mode(), torch.autocast("cuda", dtype=torch.bfloat16):
    state = predictor.init_state(<your_video>)

    # add new prompts and instantly get the output on the same frame
    frame_idx, object_ids, masks = predictor.add_new_points_or_box(state, <your_prompts>):

    # propagate the prompts to get masklets throughout the video
    for frame_idx, object_ids, masks in predictor.propagate_in_video(state):
        ...
```

Please refer to the examples in [video_predictor_example.ipynb](./notebooks/video_predictor_example.ipynb) for details on how to add click or box prompts, make refinements, and track multiple objects in videos.
